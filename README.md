## Extensible standards auditing and linting tool. Nags like your mother but is probably a lot more technical.

---

With StandardLint, you use _Checks_ to inform what standards you want to inspect, in effect being your standards _yardstick_:

> A fact or standard by which you can judge the success or value of something.
> — [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/standardlint)
